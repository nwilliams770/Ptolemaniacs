# Ptolemaniacs
A force-directed graph layout of the [Ptolemaic Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_dynasty). Data for this project was hand-written but sourced from Wikipedia. Please note that specific dates are still debated amongst scholars and should be considered when viewing this visualization. 

Many thanks to [Mike Bostock](https://github.com/mbostock) for such comprehensive support and examples.

## Implementation
This project served as an oppurtunity for me to familiarize myself with the [d3](https://github.com/d3/d3) API whilst exploring a topic I particularly enjoy. Using the d3 API I implemented a force-layout with the following features:
* Node data filters
* Node immediate family filter
* Drag and drop
* Tooltips
* Responsive visualization
