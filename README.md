# Ptolemaniacs
A force-directed graph layout of the [Ptolemaic Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_dynasty). This project served as an oppurtunity for me to familiarize myself with the [d3](https://github.com/d3/d3) API whilst exploring a topic I particularly enjoy: Ancient History.

Many thanks to [Mike Bostock](https://github.com/mbostock) for such comprehensive support and examples.
